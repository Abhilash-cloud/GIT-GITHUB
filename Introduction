 # Git & GITHUB #

Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. 




## How to add a GIT repository ##

mkdir <dir-name>
cd <dir-name>
git init

## via this your local git repository is working and we can use it as per expected ##

But if we have to upload the code in code repository than we have to use the GITHUB url:

go to github.com
and create a repo
once done copy the URL of that repo:

goback to VM  where the local gitrepo was created:

git remote add origin URL

touch filename
git add .
git status
git commit -m "firstmessage" .
git push -u origin master


Cases:
## git remote add origin URL##
if we get a pop something like this saying "remote already exists":
=====>> it means that you already have a repo with same origin name already somewhere in your local Git

git remote -v
this will show if origin is mapped to the remote URL or not

try deleting that origin (this will delete the local gitrepo origin)
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin URL  (here either you can change the name of the "origin" to something else:
git push -u origin master  (in place of "origin" select the name that you selected above )

OR:
git remote rename <current-name> <new-name>
git remote add <new-name> url
